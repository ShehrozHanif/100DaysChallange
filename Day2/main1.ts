// Day 02

// Question No 4: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. 
// Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks: "Albert Einstein once said, 
// “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"

let author = "Imran Khan"
let quotation ="You only loose when you give up"
console.log(`"${author} once said,"${quotation}""`)




// Question No 5: 
/* Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message 
and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message. */

// I already did in Question no 1 in short both answer in Q1




// Question No 6:
/* Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and
 "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping 
 the white spaces. */

// With Extra Space and NewLine
let name1 = "\t\n Shehroz \t\n"
console.log(name1);

// // Now remove the Extra Spaces 
console.log(`${name1.trim()}`)
