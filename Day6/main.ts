// // As you can see or know we already invite some guest in our previous Program
// //but this time we found a bigger Dinnig table so we invite more guest

console.log("we found a bigger Dinner Table so we need more guest")

// // Adding More Guest(At teh beginning ,Middle, and End)

oldGuest.unshift("Mrs Imran Khan");
// //Unshift is used to add at the Beginning

oldGuest.splice(2,0,"Muraad Saeed")
// // Splice is used to add where you want in the array and also for replace

oldGuest.push("Yateem Bacho")
// // push Function is use to add the end 

// // Now the Process of iteration

for(let i =0; i<oldGuest.length; i++){
    let invitation:string ="I would like you to invite on dinner"
    console.log(`${invitation} ${oldGuest[i]}`)
}

// //So as you can see we add more guest in the beginning , Middle and End


//       //          //        Question no 17  //        //          //            //          // 

//Question 17
//  console.log(" As you know due to shortage of table I can invite only 2 people")

//  Remaining Guest will be remove
// let GuestList:string[] =["Mrs Imran khan","Imran Khan Sahab","Murad Saaed","Tariq Jameel Sahab","Sir Zia","Yateem Bacho"]
// // let remove:string[] = GuestList.slice(0,2)
// console.log(remove)

// //As you can see with the help of Slice function we remove other Guest and invite only 2

// for(let i =0; i<remove.length; i++){
//     let invitation:string ="would like you to come on dinner"
//     console.log(`${invitation} ${remove[i]}`)
// }

// This is one of the way which i found to solve this Question 
// The Question demand due to shortage of table we need to cancel the invite of more than 2 guest

// let me try Another way beacuse i am not satisfy with this becasue it's not look like programer type

                                   //   // Question No 17 (Again) 

console.log("Unfortunately,new table won't arrive sp I can only invite two people for dinner.");

let GuestList:string[] =["Mrs Imran khan","Mr Imran Khan Sahab","Murad Saaed","Tariq Jameel Sahab","Sir Zia","Yateem Bacho"]

if(GuestList.length>2){
   let removedGuest = GuestList.splice(2);
   for(let i =0 ; i<removedGuest.length; i++ ){
    console.log(`Dear ${removedGuest[i]} i can't invite you for dinner`)
   }
}


// So i'll explain you what i did in this program 
// First of all using If estatement that if Guestlist greater than use a splice function 
// So GuestLength = 6 , than its implement and its returning value save in a variable called removedGuest
// In this removedGuest we save retutning value which is starting from Guestlist.length(3) till end.
// Then as usall Iteration and put in iteration 


for(let i = 0 ; i<GuestList.length; i++){
    console.log(`Respected ${GuestList[i]} you are invited for dinner`)
}
//// Now in this we use the reaming value which is left in Guestlist after splice it
//// Remaing Value is "Mrs Imran khan ", "Mr Imran Khan Sahab" we use for invite 

GuestList.splice(0)
console.log(GuestList)

// And in the last we show that we have a list of an Array in only 2 pick and rest of all Eliminated so the Array will be Empty 
// As you can see in the terminal when it console.log()

// // So the moral of this question is that because of new table won't arrive so we remove some people from our guess list and in the end show the 
// // list empty.


                                                   // Question No 18

let places:string[] = ["Norway","Swizerland","Canada","Greenland","United KIngdom"]


console.log("Original order:", places);
// This is an Origanl Array[]

console.log("Alphabetic order:", [...places].sort());
// This will make the Array[] in Alphabetic Order

console.log("Orignal order:", places)
// Now again this will show you in Orignal Order

console.log("Reversr Alphabetic Order:", [...places].sort().reverse())
// In this Array we make a reverse Alphabetic  order 

console.log("Orignal Order:", places);
// Now again show the orignal Array[]

places.reverse();
console.log("Reversed order:", places)
//Now again reverse the Array [] now the question in mind if we can reverse with this method so why we use the First Method
//i'll explain the first Method dont effect the orignal Array[ ] it remain same after apply this method

// And when we apply This Method it will change the orignal Array[] and then its orignal form change to what function we apply
// Both function work same only the difference is Orignal Array[]

places.reverse();
console.log("Orignal Order:", places);
// For become Orignal order we have to reverse again because i told you orginal form dont exist with this method thats why we are doing this.

places.sort();
console.log("Alphabetic Order:", places)
// Now it will change into Alphabetic Order

places.reverse();
console.log("Reverse Alphbrtic Order:", places)
// Now the reverse the Alphabetic order


// So what we learn in this code Two different way of Sorting both work same only differnt in orignal Array[]
